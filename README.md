All Star Simulator
==================

A simulator that allows you to create new teams
of NBA players and find out how they would
perform in a simulated game, by using real-word
statistics.

*By Manav Gagvani and Dev Kodre*

Instructions
============

Welcome to All Star Simulator! To begin, select the season from the drop down menu, by

will see the main display of All Star Simulator. You can 
select players in the drop down menu, and add them to either team using the **"Add Team"**
buttons. Furthermore, if you accidentally put in the wrong player, you can use the **"Delete Team"**
buttons. Once you have put 5 players in each team, presss the **Start** button to start the simulation. 
If you want to stop the simulation, press the **Cancel** button. If you want to exit the app, press the 
**Quit** button. If you want to clear the score and players, press the **Reset** button. 
You will see the amount of points each player scores next to his name. The scoreboard is below the players.
